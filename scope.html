        <h2>Project Scope</h2>
        <p>Our company's core business is the specialized design, fabrication, and extensive testing of advanced robotic satellites for interplanetary exploration, leveraging unique propellant-less propulsion technology. Our product is a highly capable robotic satellite, designed to investigate other planets, moons, and asteroids across the solar system. Our key capability lies in our deep expertise across satellite technologies, from initial concept to rigorous pre-launch validation. Our technical capabilities, staffing, and equipment for this project are detailed in the company information section.<br><br>

        We do not engage in rocket design or manufacturing, and we also do not handle the physical transportation of our satellites to launch sites. For launch services, we will strategically partner with specialized providers like <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rocket Lab</span> - due to their history with interplanetary launches, the capability of their Neutron rocket for larger payloads, and their crucial global communication network, including radio telescope hardware, which is essential for deep space missions.<br><br>

        Regarding the transportation of the satellite, we will use a specialized partner. They will be responsible for providing custom-fit, climate-controlled, and vibration-dampened containers to safely transport the satellite. This partner will also handle detailed logistics, and provide real-time tracking from our facility to Rocket Lab's launch site at the Māhia Peninsula. Our team will handle the packing of the satellite, as well as the unpacking and rebuilding once it arrives at the launch site.<br><br>

        We have chosen  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Yusen Logistics</span> as the primary shipping company to get our satellite(divided into large parts) safely and reliably transported to Rocket Lab's launch site.They have a dedicated aerospace allocation, which means they are not just a general freight company but one that understands the specific demands of this sector. They highlight their expertise in handling a wide range of aerospace-related transport capabilities.<br><br>

        For transporting our RTG we need to contact the  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Office of Radiation Safety</span> directly. As the regulatory body for New Zealand, they will provide a list of approved and licensed transport companies with the legal and technical capability to ship Class 7 radioactive materials.<br><br>

        In terms of legal requirements, as the owner and operator of the robotic satellite, our company is legally required to obtain a Payload Permit from the  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">New Zealand government</span>, specifically the  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Minister for Space</span> (administered by the <span style="text-decoration: underline">Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment - MBIE)</span>, under the Outer Space and High-altitude Activities Act 2017. This is a crucial authorization that confirms our satellite's design is safe, its operations are responsible, and it aligns with both national interests and international space law. This includes providing an orbital debris mitigation plan.<br><br>

        We must also secure Ground-Based Space Infrastructure (GBSI) Authorization for activities related to our satellite's communication, tracking, and control - ensuring robust cybersecurity and compliance with the Outer Space and High-altitude Activities Amendment Bill, which includes due diligence for partners like Rocket Lab. <br><br>

        We are responsible for securing all necessary radio spectrum licenses from New Zealand's Radio Spectrum Management (RSM) for our satellite's communication frequencies, and establishing data sharing agreements with Rocket Lab to ensure secure, live data feeds from their network to our offices, while complying with New Zealand's Telecommunications Act.<br>
        </p>
        <h4>Why do we require a launch vehicle?</h4>
        <div style="width: 80%; padding-left: 3vw;">
            <li>Overcome Earth's gravity - Rockets provide the immense initial thrust necessary to escape Earth's powerful gravitational field.
            </li>
            <li>Penetrate the atmosphere - Rockets are designed to safely and efficiently travel through the dense layers of Earth's atmosphere.
            </li>
            <li>Achieve initial orbit - The launch vehicle's primary role is to carry our satellite hardware to Low Earth Orbit (LEO), typically at an altitude where atmospheric drag is negligible. Once in LEO, our propellant-less propulsion system can then activate, generate continuous thrust, and begin its autonomous journey to its designated mission trajectory, whether that's higher Earth orbit, Lunar orbit, or deep space.
            </li>
        </div>
        <h4>Why do we require a designated time slot?</h4>
        <div style="width: 93%; padding-left: 3vw;">
            <p style="margin-left: -3vw; font-weight: 1;">Getting our satellite into its exact orbital path is incredibly precise. We need to hit a very specific inclination and altitude, or even line it up for a rendezvous point if in case the satellite needs re-entry(whether it's planned or an emergency). This means the launch must occur when Earth's rotation perfectly aligns with our desired trajectory, creating incredibly narrow “launch windows” that might only last minutes on certain days.<br><br>
            Reserving these time slots are also critical for a few key reasons:
            </p>
            <div style="width: 80%;">
            <li>Keeping everyone safe: We have to make sure the launch corridor is completely clear of all air and sea traffic. A set launch time lets us clear these areas and keep them safe throughout the launch.<br>
            </li>
            <li>Avoiding space collisions: Orbit's getting really crowded. A specific launch time ensures our path and initial orbit won't clash with existing satellites, space debris, or other planned launches.<br></li>
            <li>Coordinating ground crews: Launching takes a large team of ground stations, tracking radars, and communication relays. A fixed time slot means all these crucial assets can be fully staffed, calibrated, and ready to go.<br></li>
            <li>Logistical coordination: Launch providers manage incredibly tight schedules, managing multiple clients and their specific rockets. A firm time slot locks in our chosen launch vehicle and its pad, ensuring everything's ready for us.<br></li>
            <li>Payload integration: Getting our satellite meticulously connected to the launch vehicle is a complex process that demands precise planning and a defined timeline. Every minute counts, and a set launch window helps us plan accordingly.<br></li>
            <li>Weather conditions: Plays a huge role in any launch. Having a designated time slot allows us to plan for contingencies, giving us the flexibility to reschedule within acceptable windows if conditions are unfavourable, mitigating inherent risks and unpredictability.<br><br></li>
            </div>

            <h2>How we will make money</h2>
            <h4>Satellite as a Service (SataaS) / Data as a Service (DaaS):</h4>
            <div style="width: 80%; padding-left: 3vw;">
                <li>Selling data and insights: This is a primary revenue stream. The satellite's set of modules (Metal Detector, Gravimeter, Visible/IR/UV cameras, magnetometers, radio spectrum) collect valuable data. This data can be processed, analyzed, and sold as raw data to various target groups.
                </li>
                <li>Academic and research institutions: Licensing data for their studies, potentially for groundbreaking discoveries in planetary science, atmospheric studies, or Earth observation.
                </li>
                <li>Earth & environmental scientists: Selling data for weather forecasting, climate modeling, environmental monitoring (deforestation, pollution), geological surveys, oceanographic research, and hydrological studies.
                </li>
                <li>Subscription models: Offering ongoing access to data streams or analytical tools on a subscription basis.
                </li>
                <li>On-demand services: Allowing customers to request specific imaging or data collection for a fee.
                </li>
            </div>
            <h4>Mission-Specific Contracts and Partnerships:</h4>
            <div style="width: 80%; padding-left: 3vw;">
                <li>Government grants and contracts: These contracts often cover the design, build, launch, and operation of the satellite for a defined mission objective. This is particularly relevant for planetary exploration or specialized Earth science missions.</li>
                <li>Collaborative projects with academic institutions: Partnering with universities and researchers can allow us to secure funding such as research grants, and our company provides the specialized hardware, software, and expertise to execute the space segment of their research.</li>
                <li>Commercial contracts for resource exploration: Offer reconnaissance and prospecting services to asteroid mining and lunar resource companies, compensated with equity.</li>
            </div>
            <h4>Technology Licensing and Development:</h4>
            <div style="width: 80%; padding-left: 3vw;">
                <li>Propellant-less propulsion system: If our innovative propulsion system is truly groundbreaking, we could license this technology to other space companies for their satellites or spacecraft, generating significant intellectual property revenue.</li>
                <li>Specialized instrument sales: While the focus is on a full satellite, if certain instruments are highly advanced and modular, we could sell these as standalone payloads to other satellite manufacturers or research institutions.</li>
                <li>Expertise and consulting: Offering consulting services based on our deep expertise in deep space navigation.</li>
                <li>Licensing our software: Our in-house simulation and modelling software can be licensed to customers in order to model and simulate various scenarios for missions. We can use our simulation software to create and deliver training courses on space mission planning, orbital mechanics, and satellite operations.</li>
            </div>
            <h4>Future Opportunities:</h4>
            <div style="width: 80%; padding-left: 3vw;">
                <li>In-situ resource utilization(ISRU) support: As resource exploration companies mature, there will be demand for more advanced ISRU support, which could involve more specialized satellites or even direct involvement in resource extraction operations.</li>
